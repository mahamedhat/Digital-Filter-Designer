### Introduction

Applying digital filter on either live generated or uploaded signal is a very important application in understanding fourier transform and z transform. Our goal was to create neat designed website that is quick and user friendly to help students apply their filters on any signal and study the effect of any filter on a signal.

### Brief Explanation & Features

- The project idea is based on z-transform where different features are applied such as:
  - Use z-transform calculations by placing zeros or poles on the unit circle to apply various filters on any signals.
  - Phase correction by using All Pass Filter method.
- Dynamic & Responsive live signal generation after applying the filter immediatly
